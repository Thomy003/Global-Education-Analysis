# Global-Education-Analysis

## INTRODUCTION
Education as many of us now, is a right everyone should have, since education is what makes us bright and excel at every goal we pursue and discover new interesting things. Nevertheless, education hasn't been garanteed to everyone and still is not in some countries, people with lower incomes and even genders.
A good education offers individuals the opportunity to lead richer, more interesting lives. At a societal level, it creates opportunities for humanity to solve its pressing problems.
The world has gone through a dramatic transition over the last few centuries, from one where very few had any basic education to one where most people do. This is not only reflected in the inputs to education – enrollment and attendance – but also in outcomes, where literacy rates have greatly improved.

Getting children into school is also not enough. What they learn matters. There are large differences in educational outcomes: in low-income countries, most children cannot read by the end of primary school. These inequalities in education exacerbate poverty and existing inequalities in global incomes.

## OBJECTIVE
The aim of this Dashboard is to analyze and get insights from a dataset with information about Education arround the world and start wondering how well this new world is making up so everyone gets access to education.
All the information about the dataset can be obtained in /link(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/global-education)

### DataSets
* The first dataset "share-of-the-world-population-with-at-least-basic-education" contains information about the share of adult population (older than 15) who has received some basic education.
* The second dataset "learning-adjusted-years-of-school" contains information about the adjusted years of education. This is not the total number of years that a children spends in school, but a measure that researchers adjust for the quality of education to estimate how many years of quality learning they receive using an indicator called “learning-adjusted years of schooling”
* The third dataset "number-of-out-of-school-children" contains information about the number of children who aren't in school across primary and secondary education. Many children who attend primary school drop out and do not attend secondary school. That means many more children or adolescents are missing from secondary school than primary education.
* The fourth dataset "gender-gap-education-levels" contains information about the number of educational establishments enrollment by gender.
