# Global-Education-Analysis

## INTRODUCTION
Education is a basic right that everyone should have. It helps people build their futures, achieve their goals, and connect with the world. Yet, many people still do not have access to quality education, especially in low-income areas and among certain groups. These gaps in education, based on income and gender, prevent progress toward a fair education system for all.

Over the past few centuries, education has changed dramatically. What once was available to only a few is now recognized as essential for most people. We see this change in the rising number of students enrolling in schools and the increase in literacy rates worldwide. However, getting children into schools is not enough; the quality of their education is just as important.

In many low-income countries, many children finish primary school without being able to read or write well. This lack of education limits their potential and keeps poverty in place, deepening gaps in global income. To create a better and fairer future, we must address these education gaps and make sure that education can be a powerful tool for change.


## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this analysis is to examine a dataset containing global education information. Aiming to gain insights into how well the current systems are providing access to education for everyone. By doing so, we will explore the state of education worldwide and identify areas for improvement. 

You can find detailed information about the dataset at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/global-education">Kaggle</a> and <a href="https://databrowser.uis.unesco.org/">Unesco</a>.


### DataSets
* The first dataset "share-of-the-world-population-with-at-least-basic-education" contains information about the share of adult population (older than 15) who has received some basic education (comprises primary education and lower secondary education).
* The second dataset "learning-adjusted-years-of-school" contains information about the adjusted years of education. This is not the total number of years that a children spends in school, but a measure that researchers adjust for the quality of education to estimate how many years of quality learning they receive using an indicator called “learning-adjusted years of schooling”
* The third dataset "number-of-out-of-school-children" contains information about the number of children who aren't in school across primary and secondary education. Many children who attend primary school drop out and do not attend secondary school. That means many more children or adolescents are missing from secondary school than primary education.
* The fourth dataset "gender-gap-education-levels" contains information about the number of educational establishments enrollment by gender.

* At the top of the dashboard we can see a ribbon that allows users to filter all the data gathered base on continent and country for a more deep and focus research. One thing to keep in mind is that all this data from has been obtained from the <a href=https://data.worldbank.org/>World Bank Open Data</a> and there might be some missing information about some countries, due to the lack of resources to carry out the surveys, hidden information from countries, among other special reasons.
