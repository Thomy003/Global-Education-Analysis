# Global-Education-Analysis

## INTRODUCTION
Education is a basic right that everyone should have. It helps people build their futures, achieve their goals, and connect with the world. Yet, many people still do not have access to quality education, especially in low-income areas and among certain groups. These gaps in education, based on income and gender, prevent progress toward a fair education system for all.

Over the past few centuries, education has changed dramatically. What once was available to only a few is now recognized as essential for most people. We see this change in the rising number of students enrolling in schools and the increase in literacy rates worldwide. However, getting children into schools is not enough; the quality of their education is just as important.

In many low-income countries, many children finish primary school without being able to read or write well. This lack of education limits their potential and keeps poverty in place, deepening gaps in global income. To create a better and fairer future, we must address these education gaps and make sure that education can be a powerful tool for change.


## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this analysis is to examine a dataset containing global education information. Aiming to gain insights into how well the current systems are providing access to education for everyone. By doing so, we will explore the state of education worldwide and identify areas for improvement. 

You can find detailed information about the dataset at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/global-education">Kaggle</a> and <a href="https://databrowser.uis.unesco.org/">Unesco</a>.


### DataSets
* The first dataset "share-of-the-world-population-with-at-least-basic-education" contains information about the share of adult population (older than 15) who has received some basic education (comprises primary education and lower secondary education).
* The second dataset "learning-adjusted-years-of-school" contains information about the adjusted years of education. This is not the total number of years that a children spends in school, but a measure that researchers adjust for the quality of education to estimate how many years of quality learning they receive using an indicator called “learning-adjusted years of schooling”
* The third dataset "number-of-out-of-school-children" contains information about the number of children who aren't in school across primary and secondary education. Many children who attend primary school drop out and do not attend secondary school. That means many more children or adolescents are missing from secondary school than primary education.
* The fourth dataset "gender-gap-education-levels" contains information about the number of educational establishments enrollment by gender.

### RIBBON

* At the top of the dashboard we can see a ribbon that allows users to filter all the data gathered base on continent and country for a more deep and focus research. One thing to keep in mind is that all this data from has been obtained from the <a href=https://data.worldbank.org/>World Bank Open Data</a> and there might be some missing information about some countries, due to the lack of resources to carry out the surveys, hidden information from countries, among other special reasons.


### FIRST SECTION
*Below the ribbon, the first section provides key insights into global education trends through essential KPIs and visualizations. It highlights the distribution and accessibility of education worldwide (or in selected regions based on applied filters). The metrics showcase adjusted years of schooling, adult education levels, out-of-school students, and enrollment trends across different education levels, offering a clear picture of progress and challenges in education over time.

DISCLAIMER: Some inconsistencies in the data happen for the already explained reasons of countries not showing or taking part of the surveys to get Educational information.

* The top KPI shows the Adjusted Years of School (AYS) during 2020, a measure that combines the quantity and quality of education across countries, in which there is a trend where poor or less developed countries have lower AYS, between 2 and 6 points, whereas richer and more developed countries have AYS above 10 points. For example, the bottom countries with less AYS points are Liberia (2.2), followed by South Sudan (2.5), Mali (2.6), Central African Republic, Niger (2.7) and Chad (2.8). On the other hand the top countries are Singapore (12.8), followed by Hong Kong (11.9), Canada, Estonia, Finland, Japan and South Korea (11.7)

* The pie chart below, represents the percentage of Adult people (+15 years old) with some basic education in 2020, we can also see a similar trend where rich countries with high AYS have bigger rates of population with basic education. Nevertheless, in recent years the amount of people with basic education is about 9 of 10 people, which has been a great increase compared to past results where only 1 out of 5 could get basic education.

*To the right we have a line chart showing the amount of out of school students by gender from 2000 to 2020, we can see that there has been a decresed in the total number of out of school students closign the gap between males and females. One interesting fact is that in 2013 there is a peak on the amount of out of school students, because India's report on this matter has been meassured only once in 2013, hence without India the 2013 peak would get smoother. The same happens when looking at some continents such as Oceania where Papua New Guinea has registed out of school students once on 2016.

* Finally on the right we have a line-area chart showing the enrollment of students on each education level. From this graph we can see a pattern which is that every education level has increased throughout the years, specially tertiary education that has been growing with high speed on recent years. Inconsistencies on the graph might occur when looking at specific regions, specially if thrououth the years some countries have shared data or not, making this rates vary a lot if rich or poorer countries shared their data.
