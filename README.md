# Global-Education-Analysis

## INTRODUCTION
Education as many of us now, is a right everyone should have, since education is what makes us bright and excel at every goal we pursue and discover new interesting things. Nevertheless, education hasn't been garanteed to everyone and still is not in some countries, people with lower incomes and even genders.
A good education offers individuals the opportunity to lead richer, more interesting lives. At a societal level, it creates opportunities for humanity to solve its pressing problems.
The world has gone through a dramatic transition over the last few centuries, from one where very few had any basic education to one where most people do. This is not only reflected in the inputs to education – enrollment and attendance – but also in outcomes, where literacy rates have greatly improved.

Getting children into school is also not enough. What they learn matters. There are large differences in educational outcomes: in low-income countries, most children cannot read by the end of primary school. These inequalities in education exacerbate poverty and existing inequalities in global incomes.

## OBJECTIVE
